# FunWithAPIs
Resources to support a Java workshop about combining APIs

# Introduction
This repository contains code and resources to support the [Brighton Java Fun With APIs workshop](https://www.meetup.com/Brighton-Java/events/264746384/).

# Workshop
There is a good resource of [public APIs on github](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis). The workshop will involve picking two of these APIs and combining them (what used to be referred to as [a mashup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(web_application_hybrid))). 

This repository contains a basic example using Spring Boot that can be customised.

# Resources
* A comprehensive [guide to APIs](https://github.com/Kikobeats/awesome-api)
* Some interesting posts from have-i-been-pwned about APIs, one on [adding authetication to APIs](https://www.troyhunt.com/authentication-and-the-have-i-been-pwned-api/), and another on [pragmatic versioning](https://www.troyhunt.com/your-api-versioning-is-wrong-which-is/).
* An example using [JAX-RS and Jersey to read XML/JSON apis](https://www.baeldung.com/jersey-jax-rs-client)
* Another [Jersey/REST example](https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/REST/article.html)
* I've written a [blog post on the workshop](http://jamesburt.me.uk/uncategorized/fun-with-apis/) which includes a simple example; the comments are available for people to list what they've done
